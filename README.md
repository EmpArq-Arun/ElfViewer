## Quick Start

```bash
pip install bottle          # one-time
python app.py               # browser opens automatically
```

Override port if needed:
```bash
python app.py 8080
```

## Usage

Drop any combination of files — each is optional:

| File            | What it unlocks                              |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `.ld`           | Memory map, regions, sections, startup cost  |
| `.elf` / `.axf` | Symbols, sizes, DMA warnings, addr→line      |
| `.map`          | Per-.o flash/RAM breakdown, GC'd sections    |
| `.su`           | Per-.su Stack depth information              |
| `.ci`           | Per-.ci Stack chain addition                 |


## Toolchain

In the sidebar **Prefix** field, paste your toolchain path:

```
arm-none-eabi-
D:\NXP\S32DS.3.6.4\S32DS\build_tools\gcc_v11.4\gcc-11.4-arm32-eabi\bin\arm-none-eabi-
D:\NXP\S32DS.3.6.4\S32DS\build_tools\gcc_v11.4\gcc-11.4-arm32-eabi\bin\
```

Trailing dash, backslash, or forward slash all work — auto-detected.

## Why File Selection Was Broken (and how it's fixed)

The monolithic version embedded `JSON.stringify(obj)` inside
`onclick="..."` HTML attributes. The browser's HTML parser sees the first
`"` in the JSON as the closing quote of the attribute — everything after
that point was broken HTML. Since `getElementById()` returned `null` for
all elements, no event listeners ever registered.

**Fix**: `drops.js` is the only file that touches file input. File inputs
are `display:none` siblings of the drop area divs (not overlaid inside
them). The div's `click` handler calls `input.click()` explicitly.
All wiring runs in `DOMContentLoaded` so the DOM is guaranteed ready.
No data is ever placed inside HTML attribute strings.

## Embedded code compiler flags that would make stack depth work

| -fcallgraph-info=su,da | Produces call-graph information with stack-cost data per edge github+1          |
| -Wstack-usage=256      | Warns at compile time when a function’s stack usage exceeds 256 bytes gcc.gnu+1 |
